python writes a single control character to arduino
arduino writes a variable number of numbers back

* 'A': // Initialize or Update
  * expect a bunch of specific data from the pi
  * water beds turned on for auto and are dry
  * set error states if they don't look watered
  * return to sleep
* 'S': // Automatic watering
  * everything commented out?
  * return to sleep
* 'M': // Manual watering
  * expect a bunch of specific data from the pi
  * water beds turned on for manual
  * set error states if they don't look watered
  * return to sleep
* 'W':        // Winterizing
  * I think try to empty water from lines?
  * return to sleep
* 'R':
  * read readVH400, sensors
  * send 8 values
  * return to sleep
* 'E': // Error comms to Pi
  * print 8 error numbers
  * return to sleep
* 'L': // Debug read sensors
  * print 8 readVH400 values
  * debug repeatedly until state changed
